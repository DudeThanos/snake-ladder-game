This setup provides a more interactive and graphical experience for this Snake and Ladder game.
The players' positions will be updated on the board as you roll the dice.

At the present the snakes & ladders images are only visible on single point so for reference
the connection of both snakes and ladders are shown on both the side of the board.

The game can be restarted using the restart button.
